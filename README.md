## Reflections
Being one of my first PHP server-side `Local File Inclusion (LFI)` vulnerability challenges attempted, this challenge made me aware of how LFI can be exploited and input filters can be bypassed (even without the source code of the web application), from an attacker's point of view.

While building web applications that are functional and intuitive, it is also important to consider that they are secure from attacks.
